This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

// Quarter-2 Class-2 Assignment:
// Create two new components in a Next.js application: Header and About. Then, import them
// into the homepage Ul. Additionally, review the files and folder structure of Next.js in detail.



/*
In a Next.js project, the folder structure is organized to streamline routing, component management, styling, and static assets:

components/: Stores reusable React components (e.g., Header.tsx, About.tsx), used across different pages.

pages/: Each file becomes a route automatically, such as page.tsx for the homepage and any additional pages.

package.json: Defines dependencies and scripts for the project.
This structure keeps the project modular and organized, especially as it grows.*/
